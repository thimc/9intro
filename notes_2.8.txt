Q: Why was not zero the first address used by the memory image of
program 02_global.c?
A: Because of an abstraction called virtual memory.  Each program that
is executed (loaded in to memory) are broken down in to memory
segments.  There's the (program) text segment that contains
instrouctions that can be executed but not modified, there's the data
segment that contains initialized data for the program.  Lastly,
there's the bss segment that contains uninitialized data.  Finally
there's the stack segment that is used for reading and writing to
memory.


Q: Write a program that defines environment variables for arguments.
For example, after calling the program with options:
% args -ab -d x y z
the following must happen:
echo $opta
yes
echo $optb
yes
echo $optc
yes
echo $args
x y z
A: See file solution2.8_args.c

Q:  What would print /bin/ls /blahblah (given that /blahblah does not
exist).  Would ls /blahblah print the same?  Why?
A: The output would be the same, in this instance /bin is part of the
$path variable, meaning that all rc(1) will look for executable in
these folders before resorting to the current working directory.

Q: What happens when we execute
% cd
after executing this program. Why?
#include <u.h>
#include <libc.h>
void
main(int, char*[])
{
	putenv("home", "/tmp");
	exits(nil);
}

Q: What would these commands do? Why?
% cd /
% cd ..
% pwd
A: The current directory would still be / (or the root directory)

Q: After reading date(1) change the environment variable _timezone_
to display the current time in New Jersey (East coast of US).
A:
% date
.. local time ..
% cp /adm/timezone/US_Eastern /env/timezone
% date
.. US Eastern time ..

Q: How can we know the arguments given to a process that has been
already started?
A: % cat /proc/<pid>/args

Q: Give another answer for the previous problem.
A: % ps -a | grep <pid>

Q: What could we do if we want to debug a broken process tomorrow and
want to power off the machine now?
A: 

Q: What would happen if you use the debugger, acid, to inspect 8.out
after executing the next command? Why?
% strip 8.out
A: Strip removes symbol table segments from executable files.  After
stripping these symbols acid won't be able to debug the program and
quit with the message "no symbol information"
