Q: Open a system shell, execute ip/ping to determine if all of the
machines at the network 213.128.4.0 are alive or not.  To do this, you
have to run these 254 commands:
; ip/ping -n 1 213.128.4.1
; ip/ping -n 1 213.128.4.2
...
; ip/ping -n 1 213.128.4.254
The option -n with argument 1 tells ping to send just one probe and
not 64, which would be its default.
A: -

Q: Do the same using this shell command line:
; for (m in ‘{seq 1 254}) { ip/ping 213.128.4.$m }
This line is not black magic.  You are quite capable of doing things
like this, provided you pass this course.
A: -

Q: Start the system shell in all the operating systems where you have
accounts.  If you know of a machine run- ning an unknown system where
you do not have an account, ask for one and try to complete this
exercise there as well.
A: -

Q: Does your TV set remote control have its own operating system?  Why
does your mobile phone include an operating system?  Where is the
shell in your phone?
A: No


Q: Explain this:
; lc .
bin
lib
tmp
; ls.
ls.: ’/bin/ls.’ file does not exist
A: Whenver we invoke a command, rc(1) will try to find its executable
from places defined in $path.  The default is to look in the current
directory (.) or /bin.  What we're trying to do here is call upon the
executable `ls.` which does not exist.  Adding a space between ls and
the dot will however run the executable with the dot as its argument.

Q: How many users do exist in your Plan 9 system?
A: 1, the `glenda` user.

Q: What happens if you do this in your home directory? Explain why.
; touch a
; mv a a
A: We will get a en error stating that the source and the target are the same file.

Q: What would happen when you run this? Try it and explain.
; mkdir dir
; touch dir/a dir/b
; rm dir
; mv dir /tmp
A: rm(1) fails, we're trying to delete a directory and we haven't
specified the -r flag (delete recursively).  The mv(1) call would also
fail because it's a directory, mv is used for moving files.

Q: And what if you do this? Try it and explain.
; mkdir dir dir/b
; cd dir/b
; rm ../b
; pwd
A: We would end up removing the current working directory, ../ refers
to the directory "above" and since we are specfiying that we want to
remove the directory "above" followed by b which so happens to be the
directory we're in, it would end up geting removed
