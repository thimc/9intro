# 9intro

The repository contains code snippets, example programs and misc notes
for the excellent book "Introduction to Operating Systems Abstractions
using Plan9 from Bell Labs" by Francisco J Ballesteros.

For those of you who are curious and want to read it yourselves, head
on over to https://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/9.intro.pdf and download it for
free.


All of the files in this repo are numbered in ascending order
according to their presence in the book.

File names containing the letter "b" are bonus files, meaning they are
not neccesarily completely written out in the book, rather the
author(s) expand upon the programs functionality by talking about
topics that could be useful for those particular programs.

At the very end of each chapter the author asks the reader about
various topics on what they've read so I have made some notes, these
files start with "notes" along with their chapter number.

In some instances the reader is told to write a program.  These
programs are prefixed with "solution" along with the chapter.

I must warn you, the reader, that some of the questions are perhaps a
bit vaguely phrased so I've answered them as best as I could.
