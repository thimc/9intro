# 9intro

This repository contains code snippets, example programs and misc notes
for the excellent book "Introduction to Operating Systems Abstractions
using Plan9 from Bell Labs" by Francisco J Ballesteros.

For those of you who are curious and want to read it yourselves, head
on over to [doc.cat-v.org](https://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/9.intro.pdf)
to download it for free.

All of the files in this repo are numbered in ascending order
according to their presence in the book.

File names containing the letter 'b' indicate bonus files.  These
files may not be fully written out in the book; instead, the author
discusses a functionality or mechanism for readers to explore and try
on our own.

At the end of each chapter, the author prompts the reader to reflect
on various topics discussed in the book.  I have compiled some notes
on these reflections, and the corresponding files are named 'notes'
followed by the chapter number.

At times, the reader is instructed to write a program.  These programs
are prefixed with 'solution' followed by the chapter number.
